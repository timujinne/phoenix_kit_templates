defmodule PhoenixKit.Templates do
  @moduledoc """
  Renders a named message template for a recipient.

  One renderer for every channel — email, push, Telegram, SMS, the in-app inbox
  — so localized, customizable message content is built the same way everywhere
  instead of once per channel.

  ## The two layers

  A template has a **default**, shipped by the package that sends the message,
  and an optional **override**, shipped by the host application.

  The caller supplies the default already localized. That split is what keeps
  this package a leaf: translation belongs to the sending package's Gettext
  backend, and reaching for one here would mean depending on it.

      PhoenixKit.Templates.render(
        "new_login_alert",
        %{subject: gettext("New login to your account"), text: gettext("Hi {{user_email}}, …")},
        %{"user_email" => email, "ip_address" => ip},
        locale: "uk",
        paths: [Application.app_dir(:my_app, "priv/phoenix_kit_templates")]
      )

  ## On disk

  **A template's name is a DIRECTORY, never a filename.** The files inside it
  are named for the *part* they supply, optionally carrying a locale:

      priv/phoenix_kit_templates/     <- a root, passed as :paths
      └── new_login_alert/            <- the template NAME (a directory)
          ├── subject.txt             <- <part>.<ext>
          ├── subject.de.txt          <- <part>.<locale>.<ext>
          ├── text.txt
          ├── text.de.txt
          └── html.html

  | part | file | used by |
  |---|---|---|
  | `subject` | `subject[.locale].txt` | email subject, push title |
  | `text` | `text[.locale].txt` | every channel |
  | `html` | `html[.locale].html` | email only, optional |

  A directory rather than flat files because one template is up to three parts
  times however many locales a host translates — flat, they would interleave
  with every other template's files and you would be reading filename prefixes
  to tell them apart. Grouped, a template is one folder to copy, diff or delete.

  This is also why `name` is the only identifier and is validated as
  `[a-z0-9][a-z0-9_\-]*`: it is a path segment, so it must be filesystem-safe.
  It is slug-shaped by necessity, which is what makes a separate slug field a
  second spelling of a constraint the path already enforces.

  ## Resolution

  Per part, independently, stopping at the first hit. For part `subject` and a
  recipient locale of `"de-AT"`:

      1. subject.de-AT.txt      host override · exact dialect
      2. subject.de.txt         host override · base language
      3. subject.txt            host override · locale-less
      4. defaults[:subject]     the caller's Gettext default

  Roots are tried in order, so an earlier root shadows a later one.

  Independence matters. Given the tree above and a German recipient, a host that
  wrote only `text.txt` still gets the package's translated German subject; the
  override applies to the body alone. And `subject.de.txt` wins for a German
  reader while an Italian one falls through to `subject.txt`.

  ## Why the default is not a file

  A shipped default expressed as one file per locale forks the same sentence
  seven ways and drifts. Expressed as a Gettext call it rides the extraction and
  translation pipeline the sending package already runs, and ships translated.
  Files are how a *host* overrides — a host writes one or two languages, not
  seven — and how chrome-bearing HTML gets authored. See the design doc.

  ## Parts

  `subject`, `text` and `html`, named for what they are rather than for email:
  push uses subject-as-title plus text, Telegram and SMS use text alone, the
  in-app inbox uses text. `html` is genuinely optional — core's own auth emails
  ship text-only, so a template with no `html` is the normal case.

    * `:locale` — the recipient's locale, dialect included (`"en-GB"`). `nil`
