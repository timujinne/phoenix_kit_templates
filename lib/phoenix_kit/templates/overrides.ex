defmodule PhoenixKit.Templates.Overrides do
  @moduledoc """
  Locates a host application's override file for one part of one template.

  A host customizes a message by dropping a file into its own repo, where it is
  version-controlled and reviewable, instead of editing a database row through
  an admin UI. Nothing here writes; an override is only ever read.

  ## Layout

  **`name` is a DIRECTORY, never a filename.** Files inside it are named for the
  part they supply, optionally carrying a locale:

      <root>/<name>/<part>.<locale>.<ext>       text.en-GB.txt
      <root>/<name>/<part>.<ext>                text.txt

  Worked:

      priv/phoenix_kit_templates/     <- <root>
      └── new_login_alert/            <- <name>
          ├── subject.txt
          ├── subject.de.txt
          └── text.txt

  `subject` and `text` are `.txt`; `html` is `.html`. A root is typically
  `Application.app_dir(:my_app, "priv/phoenix_kit_templates")`, but this module
  takes roots as an argument and reads no configuration of its own — it must not
  know which application is using it.

  Lookup runs most- to least-specific and stops at the first file that exists:

      text.en-GB.txt   →   text.en.txt   →   text.txt

  so a host that only cares about one language writes `text.txt` and is done,
  while one that translates its overrides gets dialect precision. Roots are
  tried in order, so an earlier root shadows a later one.

  Each part is looked up separately: in the tree above, a German reader gets
  `subject.de.txt` and `text.txt`, and an Italian reader gets `subject.txt` and
  `text.txt`. A part with no file at all resolves to `nil`, and the caller falls
  back to its own default.

  ## Runtime, not compile time

  Overrides live in the *host* application, which is compiled separately from
  this package — there is no point in this package's compilation at which they
  could be read. So they are read at runtime and cached in `:persistent_term`,
  including the *absence* of a file, since a missing override is the common case
  and would otherwise cost a `File.stat` on every send. Files cannot change
  without a deploy; `reset_cache/0` exists for tests and dev reloads.

  ## Path safety

  `name` and `locale` are matched against strict patterns before they are ever
  joined onto a root. They are literals at every current call site, but this
  module turns a name into a filesystem read, and that is not a boundary to
  leave to the caller's good behaviour — `../../../etc/passwd` resolves to no
  override rather than to a file.

  The contents of the best-matching override file, or `nil` when there is none.

  `locale` may be `nil`, which skips straight to the locale-less candidate, as
  does a locale that is not a well-formed tag. `roots` must be a list — a bare
  string is a caller bug, and silently finding no overrides in it would hide
  that.

  Drops cached override lookups.

  Only tests and dev reloads need this: a deploy starts a fresh VM.

  Pass a list of roots to clear only the entries that consulted them. That
  scoping is what lets an async test clear its own `tmp_dir` without erasing a
  concurrently-running one's cache — and it is the honest shape anyway, since a
  dev reload usually means one application's files changed, not all of them.
