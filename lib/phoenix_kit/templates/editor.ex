  defmodule PhoenixKit.Templates.Editor do
    @moduledoc """
    A `Phoenix.LiveComponent` for editing a host's override files in place.

    Compiled only when the host has `phoenix_live_view`, which this package
    lists as an optional dependency: a host without it gets the renderer and
    the write API and none of this. It depends on nothing else — no PhoenixKit,
    no Gettext backend, no host assets. The markup is HEEx with daisyUI class
    names, so a Tailwind host must scan this package's `lib/` for them.

        <.live_component
          module={PhoenixKit.Templates.Editor}
          id="email-templates"
          root={MyApp.EmailTemplates.root()}
          editable={true}
          name_prefixes={["order_", "_header-shop", "_footer-shop"]}
          locales={["et", "ru", "en"]}
          preview={{MyApp.EmailPreview, :preview}}
          sample_variables={%{"order_number" => "37"}}
          after_write={{MyApp.EmailTemplates, :after_write}}
          convert={%{to_text: {MyApp.EmailTemplates, :to_text}}}
        />

    Everything is read and written through `PhoenixKit.Templates.Overrides`
    on the one `root`, so the renderer's cache is reset for that root after
    every change — pass the same root string the host renders with.

    ## Attributes

      * `:root` (required) — the host's template directory. Anything but a
        string shows an error and nothing can be written. Keep it fixed for
        the life of the page: the open form's notion of what the user left
        alone belongs to the root it was opened from.
      * `:editable` — `true` to allow saving, creating and deleting; anything
        else shows the files read-only. Default `false`. Checked again by every
        event, not only by what is rendered.
      * `:name_prefixes` — which templates this editor sees **and** may write
        or delete: names starting with one of these strings. Checked on every
        select, save, create, copy and delete. Anything but a list counts as
        `[]`, and entries that are not non-empty strings are dropped. Default
        `[]`, which shows nothing.
      * `:locales` — the language tabs, in order. A last tab, *Fallback*, edits
        the locale-less files (`text.txt`), used for any language without its
        own file.
      * `:preview` — `{module, function}` or a 2-arity function called as
        `preview(name, locale)` (`locale` is `nil` on the fallback tab, and
        `name` may be a shared part such as `_header-x`). It returns
        `{subject, html}` or `{subject, html, text}` — each a string or `nil`
        — or `{:error, reason}`. With a text version the preview has two
        tabs, *HTML* and *Text*, and a template opens on HTML (on Text when
        its HTML is `nil`); the text is shown as plain text. The HTML is
        shown in an `<iframe sandbox srcdoc>` without `allow-scripts`, so
        nothing in an edited template runs in the admin page; a
        `{:safe, iodata}` is escaped like a string, never trusted.
        Any other result, an exception, throw or exit is shown as an error
        rather than crashing the page, and the last three are logged. It is
        called on selecting a template or tab, after a save or copy, and when
        the host re-renders with a new callback, new variables or changed
        files — not for a template with no files yet. No callback, no preview
        pane.
      * `:sample_variables` — the variables a template may use, as a map of
        name to a sample value. Listed beside the editor, and any placeholder
        in the current template that is not among them is flagged. The one map
        applies to every template, shared parts included, so a host whose
        headers and footers use its layout's variables (`{{site_url}}` and
        the like) lists those too.
      * `:after_write` — `{module, function}` or a 1-arity function, called
        with the list of paths created by a save or a copy (a new template
        directory first, then files) — for example to change their owner.
        This package never does. The files are written before it is called;
        if it raises, throws or exits, that is shown as an error after the
        save's own result and logged with its stacktrace.
      * `:after_change` — `{module, function}` or a 1-arity function, called
        with the template's name after any change on disk: a save that wrote
        or deleted files, a copy (the new name) or a deleted template — for
        example to refresh what the host shows about the files. Not called
        when nothing changed. Reported and logged like `:after_write`.
      * `:convert` — the host's converters, a map with either or both keys,
        each `{module, function}` or a function. Each adds a button to the
        form; without them, and read-only, there are none.
        * `to_text: callback`, called as `to_text(:markdown, markdown)` or
          `to_text(:html, html)` — the *Fill text from content* button: the
          form's Markdown if it is not blank, else its HTML, made into plain
          text and put in the Text field.
        * `markdown_to_html: callback`, called as `markdown_to_html(markdown)`
          — the *Markdown → HTML* button: the form's Markdown rendered into
          the HTML field.

        A converter returns a string or `{:error, reason}`; anything else, an
        exception, throw or exit is an error, reported like the other
        callbacks, and the form is left as it was. It gets what is in the
        form, saved or not, with placeholders as typed, and should give them
        back as they are — `{{name}}` is for the message to fill in later:
        not substituted, and in a link target (`[Pay]({{url}})`) neither
        percent-encoded nor dropped. A Markdown renderer called with no
        variables may do either to a link target, so protect placeholders
        through it (the README's note on `markdown`). Nothing is written:
        the result waits in the form, the user's other unsaved fields as
        they were, until the user saves it.

    ## What it does

      * Lists the visible templates, captioned with their `label` part, with
        names starting with `_` (headers, footers, layouts) in a group of
        their own.
      * Edits the `label`, `subject`, `text`, `markdown` and `html` parts per
        language tab. Saving writes the parts that changed; a part saved empty
        has its file deleted, so the message falls back to the next file in
        line — and a template left with no files loses its directory, staying
        open as an unsaved one. Line breaks are stored as `\\n`. A save that
        is partly refused (one part too large, say) names the parts it saved
        and the ones it did not, which stay in the form as the user left
        them. Each tab is saved on its own: switching tabs or templates, or
        a reconnect, drops unsaved changes.
      * A part is written only when the user changed it from what the form
        was given (on opening the template or tab, or after a save): a part
        left alone is never written back over another session's change made
        meanwhile. An edited part wins — the last save of it, with no check
        that another session changed the file since. A part filled by a
        converter counts as edited.
      * The form's buttons all submit it, Save first (the form's default
        button), and a submit that names no button saves. A converter's
        button is told apart by the `action` it submits, which LiveView's
        client sends along since 1.0 — this package's minimum.
      * The host's callbacks (`preview`, `after_write`, `after_change`, the
        converters) run in the LiveView's process and block the page while
        they run: keep them fast.
      * Creates a template empty (it exists on disk once its first part is
        saved) or as a copy of a listed one — every file in its directory,
        including any of the host's own beside the parts
        (`Overrides.copy_template/3`).
      * A file that is not UTF-8 is shown as such, read-only, and never
        written over: fix it on disk.
      * Deletes a template, after a confirmation.

    The interface text is plain English: a host Gettext backend cannot be
    reached from here, and messages passed through one at runtime would never
    be extracted.
