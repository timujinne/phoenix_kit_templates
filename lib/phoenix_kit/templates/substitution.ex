defmodule PhoenixKit.Templates.Substitution do
  @moduledoc """
  `{{variable}}` substitution, with an `{{{variable}}}` opt-out from escaping.

  The double-brace syntax matches what the database-backed email templates
  used, so content exported from those rows carries over unchanged — as long
  as it contains no triple brace. `{{{variable}}}` is new in 0.2.0 and is not
  understood by those templates' own substitution: `phoenix_kit_emails` and
  `phoenix_kit_newsletters` each run their own, older `{{var}}`-only regex
  against database rows, which does not have a triple-brace rule and treats
  the outer pair as literal text around a substituted inner pair instead (see
  the boundary-case table below for exactly what that renders as). A database
  row must therefore not be written with triple braces — the opt-out is only
  meaningful once content is read by *this* package at 0.2.0 or later, for
  example a host's file override, or content exported into one.
  Surrounding whitespace is allowed: `{{user_email}}` and `{{ user_email }}`
  are the same placeholder.

  ## Escaping is per call, not per syntax

  `substitute/3` takes an `:escape` option (default `false`). When it is
  `true` — which `PhoenixKit.Templates.render/4` passes only for the `html`
  part — a `{{variable}}` value is HTML-escaped (`&` `<` `>` `"` `'`), the same
  set `Phoenix.HTML` escapes. This package has no runtime dependencies by
  design (see the README), so escaping is implemented here rather than by
  depending on `phoenix_html`. The value is always treated as data, never as
  markup to preserve: a value that already contains `&amp;` is escaped again,
  because a renderer cannot tell "already-escaped markup" from a customer name
  that happens to contain the literal text `&amp;`.

  `{{{variable}}}` (triple braces) is the escaping opt-out, for a variable that
  already holds rendered HTML — billing's `line_items_html` is the motivating
  case. It is **always substituted raw**, regardless of the `:escape` option,
  in every part. In `subject` and `text` — which are never escaped, being
  plain text — `{{{variable}}}` and `{{variable}}` are therefore identical:
  the triple-brace spelling exists so the same template content is valid
  pasted into any of the three parts, not because those parts have their own
  escaping to opt out of.

  `substitute/2` calls `substitute/3` with `escape: false`, i.e. plain
  semantics: neither syntax escapes. That is also what `subject` and `text`
  effectively get from `render/4`.

  ## Unbound placeholders are left alone, verbatim, in either syntax

  A placeholder with no matching variable is emitted **exactly as written** —
  including its own spelling of inner whitespace — not blanked. Both
  alternatives are wrong, but a visible `{{user_emial}}` announces the typo in
  a preview or a test, while a silent empty string reads as finished copy and
  ships. The renderer never raises over one — a message with a flawed
  placeholder must still send — so callers that want it to be an error ask
  `missing/2` up front.

  ## Parsing: one left-to-right pass, not "try one form, then the other"

  Both forms are matched by a single regular expression, scanned once, left
  to right. Correctness does not come from which alternative — triple-brace
  or double-brace — is written first in the pattern: at any position right
  after two `{`, the next character deterministically settles which one, if
  either, can go on to match there. A third `{` can only continue a
  triple-brace attempt; whitespace or a name's first character can only
  continue a double-brace one. The two are mutually exclusive at every
  position, so swapping their order in the pattern changes nothing — checked
  directly against every case in the table below, not just argued.

  What *does* matter is running one combined pass instead of two separate
  ones. A first pass that only recognizes `{{var}}`, run before a second pass
  for `{{{raw}}}`, would match the *inner* pair of a triple-brace placeholder
  and leave a stray `{value}` behind — the failure the plan review flagged in
  advance. A single left-to-right scan never gets the chance to make that
  mistake: for each position it asks whether either full form completes right
  there, instead of finding `{{...}}` first and only then looking outward for
  a third brace.

  Braces that do not complete a full double- or triple-brace placeholder are
  left as literal text — this is what keeps single `{`/`}` in legacy content,
  and CSS like `body { margin: 0 }` or `@media (…) { … }` inside an `html`
  part, untouched. A placeholder never spans a literal brace that is not part
  of it.

  Boundary cases, fixed by test (`substitution_test.exs`) and worth stating
  here because the "obvious" reading of a couple of them is wrong:

  | input | with `%{x: "V"}` | why |
  |---|---|---|
  | `{{{x}}}` | `V`, raw | plain triple-brace |
  | `{{{ x }}}` | `V`, raw | inner whitespace ignored, as with double braces |
  | `{{ x }}` | `V` (escaped if `escape: true`) | plain double-brace |
  | `{{{{x}}}}` | `{V}` | one literal `{` before it and one literal `}` after it; the middle seven characters, `{{{x}}}`, are the triple-brace placeholder |
  | `{{{x}}` | `{V}` (escaped if `escape: true`) | only two closing braces exist, so the triple form has nothing to complete there; the double form does, starting one character in, leaving the first `{` as literal |
  | `{{x}}}` | `V}` (escaped if `escape: true`) | mirror of the row above: the double form completes as `{{x}}`; the extra trailing `}` is literal |
  | `{ {{x}} }` | `{ V }` | single outer braces are never part of any placeholder — a placeholder always starts with two consecutive `{` |

  An unbound `x` in any of the rows above reproduces the input byte-for-byte:
  the "why" column still applies to which span is a placeholder, but a
  placeholder with no binding is emitted as its own matched text rather than
  substituted.

    * `:escape` — when `true`, a bound `{{name}}` value is HTML-escaped
      (`&` `<` `>` `"` `'`, matching `Phoenix.HTML`). Defaults to `false`.
      `{{{name}}}` is never escaped, regardless of this option — it is the
